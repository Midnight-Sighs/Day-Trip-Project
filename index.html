    <p id ="pTitle">The Normandy</p>
    <p>The Normandy is a great vacation location if you really want to get "out of this world".  The Normandy is fun and free and the odds of the ship going into combat while you're aboard are really low (so we hear) so you can be sure you'll be safe.  The ship is fully stocked with food and the crew is all aboard and available for your every need at any time!  They're there for YOU!</p>
    <p>P.S. Don't worry about the flashing red lights!</p>

    <p id ="pTitle">Gold Saucer</p>
    <p>The Gold Saucer is full of sights, sounds, and smells!  We hear the smell of Chocobo isn't the greatest, but the rest of the Gold Saucer is certainly worth the trip!  Make sure you bring PLENTY of extra pocket change (after you're settled with us, of course) to place bets and play games while you're there!  The Gold Saucer isn't cheap but it is an experience you'll never forget!!</p>

Obviously, if this was a real piece of work, I would use my own source images or ensure that the images are liscened, but in the interest of time and focusing on the practice itself, I stole images.  Bad me.</em></p>
